# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

This report is a summary of our analysis on the New York Citi Bike Program. Please follow along as we explain why you should invest with us to develop a bike share program here in Des Moines! As you follow along, please refer to our [Tableau Dashboard, linked here, for data visualization.](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ray.whelan#!/vizhome/WhelanModule14Challenge/DesMoinesBikeSharing?publish=yes)

The Citi Bike Program has been an overwhelmin success in NYC. We believe we can replicate this success, although on a smaller scale, here in Des Moines.

### NYC vs. Des Moines Commutes

We start with commute time. The Average commute time for a commuter in NYC was 40 minutes in 2018. In Des Moines, that time was only 20 minutes. We believe this number supports our idea that Iowans with shorter commutes would be willing to trade in their cars for bikes. (Data sourced from Dataus.io)

### Citi Bike Start Time Distribution

To further support this idea, we refer to our second tab, showing the top start times for Citi Bike Rides, which are noticeably clustered around commute hours. Iowans could be well served by having this additional transportation option to diversify their commutes.

### New York City Population Density, McDonald's Locations, and Citi Bike Starts

The next three tabs show a geographic breakdown of New York City's population density, the locations of McDonald's in the city, and Citi Bike Start locations. Comparing these three maps, we noticed something curious: although population density in Manhattan is lower in some of the midtown business districts, Citi Bike Starts are among the highest. Coincidentally, this part of town also has the highest density of the city's McDonald's locations. (Population density data from US Census Bureau)

### Des Moines Population Density and McDonald's Locations

Moving back to Des Moines, we see there are a few core zip codes with much of the city's density. We believe these zones will be the base of our Des Moines bike operation. McDonald's locations in the city are fairly widely distributed, so we do still plan to support  bike stations throughout the city. However, we believe these core zip codes will drive much of our bike business and that the city could benefit significantly from having an affordable commuter option permitting increased transit through and between these central zones.

### Citi Bike Ride Duration by Age and Des Moines Age Distribution

The next two tabs show the average ride length by age of rider in the NYC Citi Bike program and the age distribution of residents in Des Moines. Comparing the two charts, we see that average ride duration increases with younger riders and that Des Moines is a fairly young city with over half of its population under the age of 45. We believe this makes Des Moines a prime candidate for a bike-share program. (Age Date from US Census Bureau)

### Additional Demographic Data

The next tab shows a breakdown of Citi Bike riders by age, compared against a gender breakdown of the Des Moines population. While the Citi Bike Data is significantly skewed towards Male riders, Des Moines is fairly evenly split between genders. We find this insight to be inconclusive.

Des Moines' Income Distribution Shows a city with a strong middle class. We believe these middle income earners, earning $20-60k and making up well over half of the employed population, strongly demand new and affordable methods of commuter transportation. A bike share program for Des Moines could fit that bill perfectly. (Data from dataus.io)

Lastly, we refer to a tree chart showing a breakdown of employment in Des Moines by industry. This chart shows that a significant amount of Des Moines residents are employed in white collar industry. In other words, they do not work in fields with high physical activity demands. We believe these residents would jump at the opprtunity to build physical activity into their day through a bike share commute program. (Data from dataus.io)

## Conclusion

To conclude, we believe the demographics and geography of Des Moines make it a perfect candidate to launch a bike-share program. Thank you for joining us for this presentation; we look forward to your investment in this venture to bring a profitable new transport option to Des Moines.
